    "UK bingo cards have 9 columns x 3 rows. There are 90 balls, selected at random by a caller with a mechanical machine or a random number generator. There are variations, but a player wins when a line is matched or the whole card is matched. Game variations include matching four corners. On the bingo card, each column is populated by random numbers between 1 and 90, placed in a specific order in each column (numeric value asc.) Column 1 contains numbers 1-10, column 2 11-20, column three 21-30... and so on. Each row contains 4 blank squares. I didn't realise there was such a rule-set and thought it would be fun to try to code a card generator that obeyed the official UK Bingo rules.\n",

I was surprised at the probability theory  used to analyse the problem. For now, as I did not need to limit the number of cash prizes (and the game isn't public), I would ignore the business/ecomonics aspect of creating bingo cards. If I was coding an online casino, I would care about this.\n",
